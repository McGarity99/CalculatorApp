# CalculatorApp
Repository for JavaFX 8 implementation of Calculator App.
This project was completed to showcase my skills/knowledge of
java programming and desktop application development via JavaFX 8.
The Calculator App itself is very basic, and only allows for binary
operations (two operands) as opposed to multiple operands as common in
actual calculators. Support for more complex calculations (new operators &
increased number of operands) may be added in the future.

The user should launch the CalculatorDriver class in order
to start the application.
