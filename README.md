# CalculatorApp
Repository for JavaFX 8 implementation of Calculator App.
This project was completed to showcase my skills/knowledge of
java programming and desktop application development via JavaFX 8.
The Calculator App itself is very basic, and allows for
simple binary and unary operations. Support for more complex calculations (new operators &
increased number of operands) may be added in the future.

The user should launch the CalculatorDriver class in order
to start the application.

~Version 1.1 released September 2020~
This release adds:
-the power "^" operator for user-defined exponents
-the unary factorial "!" operator for calculating factorial values
-the unary natural log "ln(x)" operator for calculating the base-e logarithm of a number
-the unary square root operator for calculating any value's square root
-also added is the ability to perform operations on any result of a previous calculation.
  Simply leave the previous answer on display then enter another operator.
